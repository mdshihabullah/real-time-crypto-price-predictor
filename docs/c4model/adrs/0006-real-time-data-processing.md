# 6. Use Quix Streams for Real-Time Data Processing

Date: 2025-04-25

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our architecture requires a real-time data processing solution to:
1. Ingest, process, and analyze streaming data with low latency
2. Support Python-based development for rapid prototyping and production workloads
3. Integrate with cloud-native infrastructure and managed services
4. Enable collaborative development and deployment of streaming applications

We evaluated alternatives such as Apache Kafka Streams, Apache Flink, Apache Spark Streaming, and custom microservices.

## Decision

We will use Quix Streams as our real-time data processing framework because:

1. It provides a modern, Python-first API, enabling rapid development and onboarding for our team
2. It abstracts away much of the operational complexity of traditional streaming frameworks (e.g., Flink, Spark)
3. It offers built-in connectors for popular messaging systems (Kafka, MQTT) and cloud services
4. It supports collaborative development, versioning, and deployment of streaming applications
5. It is designed for cloud-native environments, supporting containerization and serverless deployment
6. The team values the productivity gains and reduced operational overhead compared to legacy alternatives

## Consequences

### Positive

- Accelerated development and deployment of real-time data pipelines
- Lower operational burden compared to managing traditional streaming clusters
- Enhanced collaboration and maintainability of streaming applications
- Seamless integration with cloud-native infrastructure

### Negative

- Smaller community and ecosystem compared to established frameworks (e.g., Flink, Spark)
- Potential vendor lock-in if relying on managed Quix services
- May require custom connectors for niche data sources or sinks
