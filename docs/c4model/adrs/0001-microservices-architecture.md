# 1. Adopt Microservices Architecture with Event-Driven Design

Date: 2024-04-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to build a real-time cryptocurrency price prediction system capable of processing market data, generating predictions, and providing timely insights to traders.

## Decision

We will adopt a microservices architecture using event-driven design with the following key components:

1. **Microservices Pattern**: Splitting functionality into discrete services for better maintainability and scalability
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Using Kafka as a message broker for asynchronous communication
3. **Feature Store**: Using RisingWave to store and serve features for ML models
4. **Model Registry**: Using MLflow to track, version, and deploy models
5. **Kubernetes**: For orchestration of all services
6. **Observability**: Implementing comprehensive monitoring with Grafana dashboards and alerts

## Consequences

### Positive

- Improved scalability through independent scaling of services
- Better fault isolation and resilience
- Technology flexibility for different microservices
- Easier continuous deployment with smaller, focused services
- Real-time data processing capability

### Negative

- Increased operational complexity
- Potential data consistency challenges across services
- More complex testing scenarios
- Need for additional infrastructure components (service discovery, API gateway)
