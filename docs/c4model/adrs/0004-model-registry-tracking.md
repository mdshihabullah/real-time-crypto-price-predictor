# 4. Use MLflow for Experiment Tracking and Model Management

Date: 2025-04-25

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our machine learning platform requires a robust solution for:
1. Tracking experiments, parameters, and results
2. Managing model versions and lifecycle
3. Facilitating collaboration between data scientists and engineers
4. Integrating with our existing Python-based ML stack and CI/CD pipelines

We evaluated several alternatives, including Weights & Biases, DVC, Kubeflow, and custom solutions.

## Decision

We will use MLflow as our experiment tracking and model management solution because:

1. It is open-source, widely adopted, and vendor-neutral, reducing lock-in risk
2. It provides a simple, language-agnostic API and UI for tracking experiments and managing models
3. It integrates seamlessly with popular ML frameworks (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch) and cloud platforms
4. Its Model Registry supports versioning, stage transitions, and collaborative workflows
5. It is easy to deploy on-premises or in the cloud, aligning with our infrastructure flexibility requirements
6. The team has prior experience with MLflow, reducing onboarding time

## Consequences

### Positive

- Standardized experiment tracking and model management across teams
- Improved reproducibility and auditability of ML workflows
- Easy integration with existing Python-based tools and CI/CD pipelines
- Flexibility to deploy on-premises or in the cloud
- Active community and ongoing development

### Negative

- Some advanced features (e.g., collaboration, reporting) are less mature than commercial alternatives
- Requires additional setup for secure, multi-user deployments
- May need custom plugins for deep integration with non-standard tools
