# 5. Use Grafana for Monitoring and Visualization

Date: 2025-04-25

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our system requires a monitoring and visualization solution to:
1. Aggregate and visualize metrics from various sources (infrastructure, applications, ML models)
2. Provide real-time dashboards for operational and business stakeholders
3. Support alerting and integration with incident management workflows
4. Scale with our growing data and user base

We considered alternatives such as Kibana, Tableau, Power BI, and custom dashboards.

## Decision

We will use Grafana as our monitoring and visualization platform because:

1. It is open-source, highly extensible, and widely adopted in the industry
2. It supports a broad range of data sources (Prometheus, InfluxDB, Elasticsearch, SQL, cloud services, etc.)
3. Its dashboarding capabilities are flexible and user-friendly, enabling rapid creation of custom views
4. It integrates natively with alerting systems and supports role-based access control
5. It is cloud-agnostic and can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud
6. The team has prior experience with Grafana, reducing learning curve and operational risk

## Consequences

### Positive

- Unified, real-time visibility into system health and performance
- Rapid dashboard development and customization for diverse stakeholders
- Scalable and extensible to new data sources and use cases
- Strong community support and frequent updates

### Negative

- Requires integration with external data sources for log analytics (e.g., Loki, Elasticsearch)
- Some advanced analytics features require plugins or external tools
- Initial setup and configuration can be complex for large-scale environments
